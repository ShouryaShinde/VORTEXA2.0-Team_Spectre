## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Upload Video** 🎬  
   Upload an educational video or lecture through the upload page.

2. **AI Transcription** ✍️  
   The backend uses **AssemblyAI** (or a similar API) to convert speech into accurate text.

3. **Summarization** 🪄  
   The transcribed text is processed using **Gemini/OpenAI** to create concise and well-structured summaries.

4. **Quiz Generation** 📝  
   Based on the summarized content, the AI dynamically generates multiple-choice questions to help users test their understanding.
